Online save file editor. 

The steps behind decryption and encryption were taken from [@KayDeeTee](https://github.com/KayDeeTee)'s [Hollow Knight Save Manager](https://github.com/KayDeeTee/Hollow-Knight-SaveManager) project. 


### Instructions 
1. Make a backup of your save file. In the Hollow Knight save folder, I'll rename `user1.dat` to `user1_a.dat`. 
1. Select or drag the source save file into the online utility. I will drag in `user1_a.dat` as my source. 
1. The online editor should show you JSON with `"key": value` pairs. Modify it to your liking. I will change my `"geo"` to `777`. 
1. Download your new **modified** save file. Once downloaded, I will rename the new `encoded.dat` to `user1.dat`, and move it to my Hollow Knight save folder. 


### Where is my save folder?
The Hollow Knight save folder may be different depending on your OS (windows, mac, linux) and game platform (steam, gog, etc). Google it like so `hollow knight mac steam save file location `.
